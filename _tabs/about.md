## Hello, I'm Huzaifa Naseer

I’m a **Software Engineer at Oracle**, where I work on building high-performance and reliable distributed systems. I graduated with a **B.Tech in Computer Science from NIT Srinagar**, and since then I’ve been focused on solving complex problems in systems engineering, optimization, and large-scale infrastructure.

Beyond my work in computer science, I’m deeply passionate about **quantitative finance, financial markets, and trading systems**. My current journey is to bridge my expertise in **C++/Rust performance engineering, distributed systems, and AI/ML** with advanced knowledge in **quantitative research and algorithmic trading**.

I aim to position myself at the intersection of **finance and technology**, developing the skills to design scalable, low-latency systems for trading and risk management.

## My Tech Stack

Generally, I like to call myself a **God Stack Developer** because I mostly use *C, C++, Rust, Typescript* in my projects and if you can read in between the lines, yes, I'm obsessed with type-based languages. Moreover, you can say I prefer to be humble and low level when it comes to speaking to computers. You can go through my work in recent years [here](/projects).

```
For the sake of it, Here is the stuff I've worked with
Languages: C, C++, Typescript, Rust, Python
Backend: Express, FastAPI
Databases: MongoDB, Postgresql, Supabase, Firebase
Frontend: Vanilla JS, React, Tailwind.css
Frameworks: Nextjs, Nuxt
Quant & Finance Tools: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, QuantLib, PyTorch
```
